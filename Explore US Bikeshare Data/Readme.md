# Explore US Bikeshare Data

The following project consist to build a python program to analise statistics of for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

This code consist is structured by 

        city, month, day = get_filters()
        df = load_data(city, month, day)
        time_stats(df)
        station_stats(df)
        trip_duration_stats(df)
        user_stats(df)


In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
