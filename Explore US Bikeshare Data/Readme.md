## Project structure

This project was structured on the following functions:

        city, month, day = get_filters()
        df = load_data(city, month, day)
        time_stats(df)
        station_stats(df)
        trip_duration_stats(df)
        user_stats(df)

get_filters()

load_data(city, month, day)

time_stats(df)

station_stats(df)

trip_duration_stats(df)

user_stats(df)
